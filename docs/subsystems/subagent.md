# Subagents

English | [中文](subagent.zh.md)

The unified activation API manages local conversations and external executions.

## Capabilities and activation requests

Every backend uses startActivation. Capability flags validate request options; prepareContinuable selects local Agent creation, while start selects one external execution. The model-facing tool uses parent delivery. Workflow and code mode consumers can await caller results without injecting another parent message. Historical children with unavailable descriptors remain discoverable as `mode: 'unknown'` without granting continuation capabilities; the [package README](../../packages/subagent/subagent/README.md) defines catalog persistence.

Optional `request.cwd` selects the child's initial directory; relative paths resolve against the parent's current effective directory. Omitting it captures that directory at admission. Local child Sessions retain the parent's original project, and cold resume retains their logged directory state.

```ts type-equiv
/**
 * Start-time options supported by a registered backend. The manager checks
 * every requested option before preparing a local child or starting an external
 * execution. depthLimit controls maxDepth; the remaining flag names match
 * SubagentStartRequest fields.

## Local children and activations

A local child has a durable Session and at most one live activation. The manager reserves identity and capacity, prepares the child through its backend, and owns input admission, cold resume, and child-first disposal. The activation result settles after resource release and completion notification. Disposal reports cleanup failure separately without replacing a captured result. Structured capture closes input for that activation; a later cold resume does not inherit the output schema.

```ts type-equiv
/**
 * What the continuation manager asks a provider for while materializing one
 * continuable child's FIRST activation. The manager has already reserved the
 * durable child identity and owns every later operation, so this request
 * carries only what distinguishes a fresh child from one seeded with parent
 * history.
 */
interface ContinuableCreateRequest {
  /** Absolute initial directory captured before provider preparation. */
  readonly cwd: string
  /** The reserved durable child session id, for provider diagnostics. */
  readonly sessionId: SessionId
  /** The delegating parent agent whose history a seeding provider reads. */
  readonly parent: Agent
  /**
   * Caller cancellation, which owns preparation only until the manager accepts
   * the initial prompt into the child's inbox.
   */
  readonly signal: AbortSignal
}
```

```ts type-equiv
/**
 * A provider's detached contribution to one continuable child's creation. This
 * is DATA, never a capability: it carries no Agent, `AgentHandle`, prompt
 * delivery, result, disposal, or resume operation, because the continuation
 * manager owns the child's whole lifecycle after preparation.
 */
interface ContinuableCreateSpec {
  /**
   * Completed-turn prefix of the parent's log to seed the child session with,
   * or absent for a fresh child. Same durable contract as
   * `CreateAgentOptions.seed`: contiguous from seq 0, lossless JSON, balanced.
   */
  readonly seed?: readonly SessionEvent[]
}
```

## Messages and interruption

sendMessage authorizes the exact live sender and permits only adjacent local agents. Running children receive steering input; absent continuable children resume from persistence. External executions reject follow-ups. Both local and external executions automatically report their final text, structured result, diagnostic, and status in the parent settlement notice. Local children can also send messages through send_message. caller delivery suppresses settlement notices. drainDescendants and drainChildren await owned work teardown for local and external activations.

```ts type-equiv
/** Durable attribution for one model-authored message between Agents. */
interface AgentMessageSource {
  readonly kind: 'agent-message'
  /** A message another agent addressed to this one (`relay` context form). */
  readonly form: 'relay'
  /** Session id of the Agent whose tool call produced the message. */
  readonly senderSessionId: SessionId
}
```

```ts type-equiv
/**
 * Durable attribution for the runtime's own account of a continuable child
 * settling. Deliberately a different kind from
 * {@link AgentMessageSource}: an Agent message is content the sender chose,
 * while this message is the manager stating what became of the child, and a
 * transcript that merged them would credit the child with words it never wrote.
 */
interface SubagentSettledMessageSource {
  readonly kind: 'subagent-settled'
  /** A runtime account shown without expanding the row (`notice` context form). */
  readonly form: 'notice'
  /** One-line account of how the child ended. */
  readonly summary: string
  /** Session id of the child that settled. */
  readonly senderSessionId: SessionId
}
```

```ts type-equiv
/** Options for one model-authored message between adjacent Agents. */
interface SubagentSendMessageOptions {
  /** Caller cancellation, owning the operation only until inbox acceptance. */
  readonly signal: AbortSignal
}
```

```ts type-equiv
/**
 * Authority under which one interrupt request is admitted. `user` carries the
 * durable direct-parent address a human client presented; `ancestor` carries
 * the exact live Agent object whose recorded lineage must contain the caller.
 */
type SubagentInterruptAuthority =
  | { readonly kind: 'user'; readonly parentSessionId: SessionId }
  | { readonly kind: 'ancestor'; readonly agent: Agent }
```

## Durable enumeration

`listChildren` reads the parent-owned catalog of all local children and parent-delivery external children. Caller-delivery external executions leave membership and result collection to their caller; local workflow children remain discoverable after completion. External entries carry `mode: 'external'` and cannot open a child Session or accept follow-ups. Catalog entries record membership at creation without execution status. `list_agents` exposes direct continuable children with `running` or `inactive` activity; see the [control tool](../../packages/subagent/tool-subagent-control/README.md#list_agents).

## Results and backend handles

SubagentResult is available to program consumers. The activation registry retains the external backend handle until disposal completes. A cleanup failure does not replace a captured execution result: the activation result and parent notice retain it, while dispose rejects and the live subagent/end event reports error. Backend-owned diagnostics must satisfy the safe-detail requirements below.

```ts type-equiv
/**
 * The terminal outcome of a subagent run, resolved by {@link SubagentRun.result}.
 */
interface SubagentResult {
  /**
   * The child's final assistant output is the content of its last non-empty
   * assistant message. Empty-content messages, including usage-only messages,
   * are skipped. Without a non-empty message, the output is its accumulated
   * assistant text stream, or `[]` when the child produced neither.
   */
  readonly output: readonly ContentBlock[]
  /**
   * The structured result after a requested `outputSchema` was successfully
   * satisfied. Requesting a schema does not guarantee presence: a provider can
   * end with `stopReason: 'error'` when the child fails or finishes without a
   * valid capture. The structured value is validated against the requested
   * output schema by the provider; `unknown` here because the seam is
   * schema-agnostic.
   */
  readonly structured?: unknown
  /**
   * Provider-authored, non-assistant failure detail for a non-`completed`
   * result. Providers keep this text free of tool inputs, file contents,
   * environment values, credentials, and raw protocol payloads, and limit it
   * to 4096 UTF-8 bytes. Consumers present it separately from {@link output}.
   */
  readonly diagnostic?: string
  /** Why the run ended. A non-`completed` reason means `output` may be partial. */
  readonly stopReason: SubagentStopReason
}
```

```ts type-equiv
/**
 * Why a subagent run ended. Merge-extensible (a backend may add variants);
 * consumers branch on the known cases and fall through `default`. The known
 * cases mirror the harness turn-end vocabulary so the tool layer can map a
 * non-`completed` result to an `isError` tool result.
 */
interface SubagentStopReasonMap {
  /** The child finished its turn normally. */
  completed: 'completed'
  /** Cancelled through the request signal or disposal. */
  aborted: 'aborted'
  /** Model or transport failure. */
  error: 'error'
  /** The child hit its token ceiling before finishing. */
  'max-tokens': 'max-tokens'
  /** The child declined the task. */
  refusal: 'refusal'
}
```

```ts type-equiv
/**
 * Backend execution handle owned directly by the activation registry.
 * A result may become available before resource release; the manager always
 * disposes the handle and awaits cleanup. Backend startup failures clean up
 * partial resources before rejecting, while accepted execution failures settle
 * through result.
 */
interface SubagentRun {
  /** Provider-minted id, unique across all parents, providers, and local Sessions in this runtime. */
  readonly id: SessionId
  /**
   * Resolves with the child's terminal {@link SubagentResult} when the run
   * settles. Does NOT reject on a child-level failure — a model/transport
   * failure resolves with `stopReason: 'error'` so the consumer maps it to an
   * `isError` tool result. Rejects on an infrastructure fault the seam cannot
   * represent as a stop reason.
   */
  readonly result: Promise<SubagentResult>
  /**
   * Cancel remaining work, reach child quiescence, and release resources.
   * Idempotent.
   */
  dispose(): Promise<void>
}
```

## The provider contract: SubagentProvider

`SubagentManager` owns startup, message admission, and execution lifetimes. Spawn and Fork contribute detached creation inputs for local Agents. Codex, Claude Code, ACP, and DSH SDK contribute one execution handle; they do not gain multiple turns. Each activation is an execution record that directly retains its AgentHandle or SubagentRun. External completion follows the handle’s result promise; inbox and idle admission belong only to local execution. Both paths share admission, capacity, parent ownership, cancellation, and disposal. The [package reference](../../packages/subagent/subagent/README.md) describes composition and deployment requirements.

```ts type-equiv
/**
 * One registered transport for running child agents. Providers are trusted
 * same-process implementations; callers treat descriptors and returned values
 * as borrowed immutable data. The service may call one provider concurrently
 * for distinct children. Providers isolate operation-local mutable state; a
 * shared capacity controller may delay an operation but must not couple its
 * settlement or cleanup to a sibling.
 */
interface SubagentProvider {
  /** Unique registry name (e.g. `spawn`, `fork`, `acp`). */
  readonly name: string
  /** The start-time features this provider supports (see {@link SubagentCapabilities}). */
  readonly capabilities: SubagentCapabilities
  /**

   * service-validated start capability: the model-facing tool derives truthful wording from it.
   * It says nothing about tool registration, injected services, or authority inheritance.
   */
  readonly inheritsParentContext: boolean
  /**
   * Optional static provider-owned provider/model route for child Agent
   * options. Consumers merge tool/model overrides over these values before
   * preflight; providers whose route derives from the parent omit it. The value
   * is detached immutable data and requires `agentOptions` support.
   */
  readonly agentRouteDefaults?: Readonly<{ provider: string; model: string }>
  /**
   * Establish one external execution and return its owned handle.

## Durable enumeration: `listChildren()`, `listDescendants()`, and their entries

The model-facing `list_agents` adapter reports current activity as `running` or `inactive`. These values do not describe task completion or guarantee that `send_message` will succeed.

`SubagentRuntime.listChildren(parentSessionId, signal?)` reads the parent's `subagentCatalog` view through a live-preferred Session observation and releases that observation on success or failure. It returns direct-child entries in parent event order without reading child logs or enumerating the Session corpus. Query failures propagate; a missing catalog projection fails explicitly. Browser rows derive membership from the shared projection store and add activity from Session status; the control stream pushes complete catalog updates. `listDescendants()` recursively reads those catalogs and derives `hasChildren` from each child catalog. [The parent-catalog Agent Note](../../.agents/notes/implemented/architecture/2026-09-01-parent-owned-subagent-catalog.md) owns creation, fork isolation, ordering, and persistence costs.

`SubagentRuntime.listDescendants(rootSessionId)` recursively calls the same catalog reader in stable pre-order, preserving each parent's event order. External entries are leaves without local Sessions. One-shot and unknown-mode entries remain traversal nodes; unknown modes produce `unsupported` diagnostics. An unreadable child catalog produces `corrupt` or `unavailable` and stops only that branch. Root read failures, missing services or projections, and cancellation reject the listing. Each reachable catalog is observed once and released before the next read; repeated ids and cycles are skipped. Sessions absent from reachable catalogs are not discovered, including ordinary Session forks and any subagents below those forks. Each row carries its catalog parent and root-relative depth:

```ts type-equiv
/** One catalog descendant with its direct parent and edge distance from the requested root. */
type SubagentDescendantListEntry = SubagentListEntry & {
  /** Parent whose catalog contains this child. */
  readonly parentId: SessionId
  /** Edge distance from the requested root; direct children are `1`. */
  readonly depth: number
}
```

#### `subagent/start` — emit

A provider established a published child. For in-process providers, `ctx.agents.get(info.id)` resolves during this notification. Scope-filtered dispatch keys the carrier by the delegating parent, so a parent-scoped listener observes only its own delegations. Paired with `subagent/end`.

 * parent-scoped listener observes only its own delegations. Paired with
 * `subagent/end`.
 * @param info - the provider and published child identity.
 * @mode emit
